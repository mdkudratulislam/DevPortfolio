                <p>If writing hundreds of lines of complicated code sounds more appealing than writing a short paragraph
                    about
                    yourself,
                    join the club. Writing a succinct bio that encapsulates who you are and what you’ve accomplished is
                    tricky.
                    But
                    with a
                    few strategies, even the most writing-averse programmers can pull it off.</p>

            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Codey! I’m a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design. In a nutshell, I create
                websites that help
                organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website
                navigation and layout
                to a company’s web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and
                the main
                languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner
                (currently taking a
                course on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shops in New
                York City.</p>
