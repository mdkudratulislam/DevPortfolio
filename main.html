            <p>If writing hundreds of lines of complicated code sounds more appealing than writing a short paragraph
                about
                yourself,
                join the club. Writing a succinct bio that encapsulates who you are and what you’ve accomplished is
                tricky.
                But
                with a
                few strategies, even the most writing-averse programmers can pull it off.</p> <br>

            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Codey! I’m a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design. In a nutshell, I create
                websites that help
                organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website
                navigation and layout
                to a company’s web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and
                the main
                languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner
                (currently taking a
                course on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shops in New
                York City.</p> <br>

                <p>“Once you have your bullet points, that’s when you start to focus on tone, structure, and the story
                    you’re telling in
                    your bio,” Cairo says. It helps to think about who will be reading this bio. A recruiter browsing
                    LinkedIn? Your
                    coworkers at a new organization? Someone you met at a networking event?</p>

                <h2>Baby Web Developer</h2>

                <p>You should also decide whether you want to write your bio in first person (like, I’m a web developer)
                    or
                    third person
                    perspective (like, Codey is a web developer). Both are acceptable, but first person bios tend to be
                    more
                    casual and
                    conversational, whereas third person ones are more formal.</p>
